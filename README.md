Corporate Retreat is a satirical browser game where you dodge falling UI components while trying to sound as corporate as possible. The gameplay alternates between movement phases, where dashboards, pricing cards, and LinkedIn posts rain from above, and writing phases, where you must respond to prompts like “QUICK!!! Announce a team milestone,” using three required buzzwords.

An AI model evaluates your writing, scores how convincingly corporate you sound, and adjusts the difficulty: strong tone calms the storm, while weaker tone triggers organizational chaos. Survival becomes a blend of platforming reflexes and your ability to deliver confident, LinkedIn-ready communication under pressure.

Built with Next.js, Supabase, and OpenAI, the game includes persistent scoring and a live leaderboard.
